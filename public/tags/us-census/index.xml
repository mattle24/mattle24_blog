      <description>This blog post is focused on how to match data from US Census tracts to US Census Places (cities) without a crosswalk table.

The most commonly used metric is the dissimilarity index, which measures how much of the minority population would have to move neighborhoods in order for the overall metropolitan area to be evenely integrated.</description>
